# Pilot flex accounting to encourage more water conservation in a combined Lake Powell-Lake Mead system

This folder contains a pilot flex water accounting tool to encourage more water conservation in a combined Lake Powell-Lake Mead system.
The tool gives each party more flexibility than current Colorado River operations to make individual water consumption, conservation, and reservoir storage decisions within the party's available water independent of other parties.
Each party's available water is their account balance plus share of inflow, minus share of reservoir evaporation, plus water purchases, and minus water sales.

Within the flex accounting, a "shared, reserve" account is added to prevent the parties from individually drawing down the combined reservoir storage to zero (dead pools). Parties may only withdraw water from the shared, reserve account when all parties agree. This rules assumes that 
the parties will not all agree on a withdraw. Thus, the water will stay parked in the account as a buffer pool, check, and balance so the parties do not collectively through their individual consumption decisions draw down the combined reservoir storage to zero (dead pools).

When the tool is moved into a Google sheet, role players representing the Upper Basin, Lower Basin, Mexico, and other parties can synchronously access and collaboratively use the tool. Players make their
year-to-year water consumption and conservation decsions while they track other players' choices and monitor combined and individual reservoir storage.

Players can explore water conservation and consumptive use strategies for different scenarios of natural flow and different political decisions
such as include more parties or stakeholders, split existing reservoir storage among users, split future inflows among users, and split the combined reservoir storage among reservoirs. 

**Can flex accounting encourage more water conservation in the Colorado River basin?** Follow the directions below to download and try out the tool by yourself or with colleagues, friends, or family.
After you complete, please share feedback -- things you like, things to improve -- with David Rosenberg at david.rosenberg@usu.edu.

## Tool Organization
The tool is organized as a spreadsheet.
 * Rows represent the components of an interactive water budget for Lake Powell-Lake Mead system. Interactive means some components of the water budget (cell fill) are:
   * Physical watershed data (Peach fill, blue text) such as inflows and reservoir evaporation,
   * Political (player) decisions (Orange fill, white text) such as individual water consumption and conservation,
   * Calculations (Grey fill), and
   * Facilitation steps (White fill).
 * Columns represent years. Each year has a natural inflow to Lake Powell, Grand Canyon Tributary flow (between Lake Powell and Lake Mead), and Natural flow between Hoover Dam and the US-Mexico boarder. Results from the end of one year carry on to the beginning of the next year.

## Requirements to Synchronously Use
1. A Google account. [Create a Google account](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?hl=en&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp)
1. One or more other participant. A participant may role play one or more parties (e.g., Upper Basin and Mexico).
1. ~ 1.5 to 2 hours (may split over multiple periods).

## Directions to Use
1. Download the file **[PilotFlexAccounting-CombinedPowellMead.xlsx](https://github.com/dzeke/ColoradoRiverFutures/raw/master/PilotFlexAccounting/PilotFlexAccounting-CombinedPowellMead.xlsx)** to your computer.
1. Move the Excel file to be a Google Sheet in a Google Drive folder associated with your Google Account.
1. Invite the other players to join the Google Sheet. Copy + share the URL to the Sheet. Or in the upper right of the Sheet, click the **Share** button, add emails, and set permissions so players can access the sheet.
1. In the Google Sheet, select the *ReadMe-Directions* worksheet. Follow the further directions to start and complete the role play.
