# Lake Mead Steady Inflow Simulations

How long does it take Lake Mead draw down, stabilize, or recover with a steady inflow and starting storage volume? Steady inflow means the same inflow volume year-after-year.

## Directions to Use
1. Download and install R and RStudio.
1. Open the **MeadSteadyInflowSimulation.R Project** file. R Studio will open
1. Select the file tab **MeadSteadyInflowSimulation.Rmd**. 
1. On the row below the file tab, click the **Knit** button. The **MeadSteadyInflowSimulation.pdf** file will generate.

## Description
The **MeadSteadyInflowSimulation.Rmd** file generates and outputs the reservoir draw down, equalize, and recover figures to file **MeadSteadyInflowSimulation.pdf**. All additional documentation is 
contained within the PDF file.

## Contents
1. **dfMeadPoolsPlot2.csv** - Lake Mead zones by elevation and name
1. **Fig0-9.jpg** - Figures generated by the file MeadSteadyInflowSimulation.R.
1. **GrandCanyonFlows.csv** - A listing of Grand Canyon and Lee Ferry flows by year from 1905-2016.
1. **HistoricalNaturalFlow.xlsx** - Downloaded from USBR. Used to estimate Grand Canyon tributary and reach gain flows between Powell and Mead. These volumes are then used to translate Mead Inflow into other metrics like Powell Release and Lee Ferry Natural flow
1. **MeadSteadyInflowSimulation.pdf** - PDF file contains all the priniciple outputs and documentation. Generated by running **MeadSteadyInflowSimulation.Rmd**. 
1. **MeadDroughtContingencyPlan.xlsx** - Spreadsheet with Mead and Powell reservoir storage-area-elevation data from CRSS and drought contingency plan schedule (cutbacks vs. Lake Mead elevation)
1. **MeadSteadyInflowSimulation.R** - R version of **MeadSteadyInflowSimulation.Rmd**. There are some differences. There is also some experimental code at the end. The file generates **Fig0-9.jpg**
1. **MeadSteadyInflowSimulation.Rmd** - R markdown file with script to generate **MeadSteadyInflowSimulation.pdf**. **See directions to run this file!**
