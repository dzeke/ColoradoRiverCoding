**The purpose of the numerical models in this Github repository are to provoke thought, discussion, and collaboration** about renegotiations of operations for Lake Powell and Lake Mead. More specifically: how to convert a shrinking pie (lose-lose) environmental conflict -- the Colorado River basin in drought -- into expanding pie (win-win) collaborations? Links to existing basin operations:

 * [2007 Interim Guidelines](https://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/programs/strategies/RecordofDecision.pdf).
 * [2019 Drought Contingency Plans](https://www.usbr.gov/dcp/finaldocs.html). **Both operations expire in 2026**.

Each numerical model includes a name, description, model structure, requirements and directions to use, model files, and comparisons to current basin operations.

Presently there is one numerical model in the repository.

## Pilot flex accounting to encourage more water conservation in a combined Lake Powell-Lake Mead system

Visuals of key features: **[PilotFlexAccounting-KeyIdeas.pdf](https://github.com/dzeke/ColoradoRiverCoding/raw/main/ModelMusings/PilotFlexAccounting-KeyIdeas.pdf)**.

## Description
Key features:
1. Give each party more flexibility to make their individual water consumption, conservation, and reservoir storage decisions independent of other parties.
1. Stretch the Lee Ferry compact point to be a region of combined management that starts with the natural inflow to Lake Powell and ends with Lake Mead releases.
1. Give each party an individual account in the combined reservoir system.
1. Include reservoir storage and inflow as operations criteria not just reservior elevations/tiers ([Rosenberg, 2021a](https://github.com/dzeke/ColoradoRiverCoding/raw/main/BlogDrafts/2-AddReservoirInflowAsNewCriteriaToRecoverLakeMead.docx)).
1. Each party makes their individual water consumption and conservation decisions within their available water. Each party's available water is their account balance, plus share of inflow, minus share of combined reservoir evaporation, plus water purchases, and minus water sales.
1. Add a "shared, reserve" account equal in volume to the current Lake Powell and Lake Mead protection volumes ([Rosenberg, 2021b](https://github.com/dzeke/ColoradoRiverCoding/raw/main/BlogDrafts/3-GiveLakeMeadManagersMoreFlexibilityToConserveToStopDrawdownToDeadPool.docx)). The shared, reserve account is managed by consensus of all parties and is intended to prevent the parties from simulataneously drawing down the combined reservoir storage to zero (dead pools). The assumption is that 
the parties will not all agree on a withdraw. Thus, the water will stay parked in the account as a buffer pool, check, and balance so the parties do not collectively draw down the combined reservoir storage to zero.

This numerical model is a structured Excel spreadsheet. When the spreadsheet is moved into a Google sheet, role players representing the Upper Basin, Lower Basin, Mexico, and other parties can synchronously access and collaboratively use the tool. Players make their
year-to-year water consumption and conservation decsions while they track other players' choices and monitor combined and individual reservoir storage.

Players can explore water conservation and consumptive use strategies for different scenarios of natural flow and different political (player) decisions. Political decisions include:
add more parties or stakeholders, split existing reservoir storage among users, split future inflows among users, and split the combined reservoir storage among reservoirs. 

**Try out the model?** Follow the directions below. Use by yourself or with colleagues, friends, or family.

## Model Structure
**Spreadsheet**:
 * Rows represent the components of an interactive water budget for a combined Lake Powell-Lake Mead system. Interactive means the players enter some components (political/management decisions) of the water budget. The different types of components (cell fill) are:
   * Physical watershed data (Peach fill, blue text) such as inflows and reservoir evaporation,
   * Political (player) decisions (Orange fill, white text) such as individual water consumption and conservation,
   * Calculations (Grey fill), and
   * Facilitation steps (White fill).
 * Columns represent years. Each year has a natural inflow to Lake Powell, Grand Canyon Tributary flow (between Lake Powell and Lake Mead), and Natural flow between Hoover Dam and the US-Mexico boarder. Results from the end of one year carry on to the beginning of the next year.

**Model Uncertainties**:
 * Hydrologic: A facillitator or player(s) choose each year's natural flows.
 * Water demands: Players enter their individual water consumption and conservation decisions year by year.
 
## Requirements to Use
1. A Google account. [Create a Google account](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?hl=en&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp)
1. Another participant (for synchronous play). A participant may role play one or more parties (e.g., Upper Basin and Mexico).
1. ~ 1 to 2 hours. Go slow. If you run out of time, schedule another session.

## Directions to Use
1. Download the file **[PilotFlexAccounting-CombinedPowellMead.xlsx](https://github.com/dzeke/ColoradoRiverCoding/raw/main/ModelMusings/PilotFlexAccounting-CombinedPowellMead.xlsx)** to your computer.
1. Move the Excel file to be a Google Sheet in a Google Drive folder associated with your Google Account.
1. Invite the other players to join the Google Sheet. Copy + share the URL to the Sheet. Or in the upper right of the Sheet, click the **Share** button, add emails, and set permissions so players can access the sheet.
1. In the Google Sheet, select the left-most worksheet *ReadMe-Directions*. Follow the further directions to start and complete the role play.
