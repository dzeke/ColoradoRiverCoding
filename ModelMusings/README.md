## Overview														
This repository gives users the opportunity to experiment with flex accounts in a combined Lake Powell-Lake Mead system. The purpose of the activity to is provoke thought and discussion about new operations for Lake Powell and Lake Mead.

## Rquirements
**Number of People**: 2 or more (facilitator may also participate).

**Time**: 1 to 3 hours.

**Software**: Facilitator has a Google Account.

## Facilitation Directions
1. Download the file **[PilotFlexAccounting-CombinedPowellMead.xlsx](https://github.com/dzeke/ColoradoRiverCoding/raw/main/ModelMusings/PilotFlexAccounting-CombinedPowellMead.xlsx)** to your computer.
1. Move the Excel file to your Google Drive. Open as a Google Sheet.
1. Open the **Versions** Worksheet to see updates.
1. Duplicate the **Master** Worksheet to save a blank version for later use. 
1. Invite 1 or more other people to join the Google Sheet. In the upper right of the Google Sheet, click the **Share** button. Add emails, and set permissions so players can access the Google Sheet. Copy and share the URL to the Sheet. 
1. Participants enter values on the **Master** Worksheet, Column A, for rows with blue text.
   1. For example, in Rows 4-10, particants select a *Party* and enter a *Strategy*. If fewer than 6 participants, participants can select multiple parties.
   1. Enter the Lake Powell natural flow for Year 1 in Cell C28.
   1. Fill in Year 1 (Column C) down to Row 142. Players enter values in blocks with #1589F0 `Blue text`
   1. Move to Year 2 (Column D) and enter Lake Powell natural flow in Cell D28.
1. Find linked help for each row in Column N.
1. View the **Master-Plots** worksheet to compare entries to current operations (Law of River).
1. **ReadMe-Directions** Worksheet also has these directions.

## Additional Information
 
 * **Visuals of Flex accounts and Combined Management**: [PilotFlexAccounting-KeyIdeas.pdf](https://github.com/dzeke/ColoradoRiverCoding/raw/main/ModelMusings/PilotFlexAccounting-KeyIdeas.pdf).
 * ** Spreadsheet structure**
   * **Rows** represent the components of the water budget for a combined Lake Powell-Lake Mead system.
   * **Colummns** represent years. 
 * **Players decide**:
      * Desecribe party strategy for next few years (individual).
	  * Water consumption and conservation (individual).
	  * Water purchases or sales: volumes and payments (joint). 
      * Add parties or stakeholders (joint).
	  * Split existing reservoir storage among parties (joint).
	  * Split future inflows among parties (joint). 
	  * Raise or lower the level of the shared water reserve account (joint)
      * Physically split combined storage between Lake Powell and Lake Mead (joint). 
 * **Existing operations**:
	  * [2007 Interim Guidelines](https://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/programs/strategies/RecordofDecision.pdf).
	  * [2019 Drought Contingency Plans](https://www.usbr.gov/dcp/finaldocs.html). **Both operations expire in 2026**.
  
## Compare to Current Operations
The **Master**, **8.1-Trade**, and **MillenniumRecover** worksheets come with companion **-LawOfRiver** and **-Plots** worksheets. Select the **-Plots** worksheets to compare flex accounting entries to current operations (Law of the River). Use the **Master** worksheet to compare your entries to current operations.
