**The purpose of the interactive models in this Github repository are to provoke thought and discussion** about renegotiations of operations for Lake Powell and Lake Mead. More specifically: how to convert a shrinking pie (lose-lose) environmental conflict -- the Colorado River basin in drought -- into expanding pie (win-win) arrangements? Links to existing Lake Powell and Lake Mead operations:

 * [2007 Interim Guidelines](https://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/programs/strategies/RecordofDecision.pdf).
 * [2019 Drought Contingency Plans](https://www.usbr.gov/dcp/finaldocs.html). **Both operations expire in 2026**.

Each interactive model includes a name, description, requirements and directions to use, model files, and comparisons to current basin operations.

Presently there is one interactive model in the repository.

## Pilot flex accounting to encourage more water conservation in a combined Lake Powell-Lake Mead system

Visuals of key features: **[PilotFlexAccounting-KeyIdeas.pdf](https://github.com/dzeke/ColoradoRiverCoding/raw/main/ModelMusings/PilotFlexAccounting-KeyIdeas.pdf)**.

## Key Features and Description

1. Give each party more flexibility to make their individual water consumption, conservation, and reservoir storage decisions independent of other parties.
1. Stretch the Lee Ferry compact point to be a region of combined management that starts with the natural inflow to Lake Powell and ends with Lake Mead releases.
1. Give each party a Flex account in the combined Lake Powell-Lake Mead system.
1. Include reservoir storage and inflow as operations criteria not just reservior elevations/tiers ([Rosenberg, 2021a](https://github.com/dzeke/ColoradoRiverCoding/raw/main/BlogDrafts/2-AddReservoirInflowAsNewCriteriaToRecoverLakeMead.docx)).
1. Each party makes their individual water consumption and conservation decisions within their available water. Each party's available water is their account balance, plus share of inflow, minus share of combined reservoir evaporation, plus water purchases, and minus water sales.
1. Add a "shared, reserve" account equal in volume to the current Lake Powell and Lake Mead protection volumes ([Rosenberg, 2021b](https://github.com/dzeke/ColoradoRiverCoding/raw/main/BlogDrafts/3-GiveLakeMeadManagersMoreFlexibilityToConserveToStopDrawdownToDeadPool.docx)). The shared, reserve account is managed by consensus of all parties and is intended to prevent the parties from simulataneously drawing down the combined reservoir storage to zero (dead pools). The assumption is that 
the parties will not all agree on a withdraw. Thus, the water will stay parked in the account as a buffer pool, check, and balance so the parties do not collectively draw down the combined reservoir storage to zero.

When the [Excel model file](https://github.com/dzeke/ColoradoRiverCoding/raw/main/ModelMusings/PilotFlexAccounting-CombinedPowellMead.xlsx) is moved into a Google sheet, role players representing the Upper Basin, Lower Basin, Mexico, and other parties can synchronously interact and collaboratively use the tool. Players make their
year-to-year water consumption and conservation decsions while they track other players' choices and monitor combined and individual reservoir storage. Players can explore water conservation and consumptive use strategies for different scenarios of natural flow and different political (player) decisions.

## Model Structure

This interactive model is a structured Excel **spreadsheet**. 
 * Rows represent the components of an interactive water budget for a combined Lake Powell-Lake Mead system. Interactive means the players enter some components (political/management decisions) of the water budget. The different types of components (cell fill) are:
   * **Physical watershed data** (Green fill, black text)
      * Reservoir evaporation rates.
	  * Current Lake Powell and Lake Mead storage.
	  * Natural inflow to Lake Powell.
	  * Grand Canyon Tributary flow.
	  * Lake Havasu / Lake Parker evaporation and evapotranspiration.
	  * Natural inflow between Hoover Dam and Imperial Dam.
   * **Individual political (player) Flex account decisions** (Light peach fill, black text) such as:
      * Water consumption and conservation.
	  * Water purchases or sales. 
	* **Joint political (player) decisions** (Orange fill, white text):
      * Add more parties or stakeholders.
	  * Split existing reservoir storage among parties.
	  * Split future inflows among parties. 
	  * Raise or lower the level of the shared, reserve account.
      * Physically split combined storage between Lake Powell and Lake Mead 	  
   * Calculations (Grey fill), and
   * Facilitation steps (White fill).
 * Columns represent years. Each year has a etween Lake Powell and Lake Mead), Natural flow between Hoover Dam and the US-Mexico boarder. Results from the end of one year carry on to the beginning of the next year.

**Model Uncertainties**:
 * Hydrologic: A facillitator or player(s) choose each year's basin natural flows.
 * Water demands: Players enter their individual water consumption and conservation decisions year by year.
 
## Requirements to Use
1. A Google account. [Create a Google account](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?hl=en&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp)
1. Another participant (for synchronous, interactive role play). A participant may role play one or more parties (e.g., Upper Basin and Mexico).
1. ~ 1 to 2 hours. Go slow. If you run out of time, schedule another session.

## Directions to Use
1. Download the file **[PilotFlexAccounting-CombinedPowellMead.xlsx](https://github.com/dzeke/ColoradoRiverCoding/raw/main/ModelMusings/PilotFlexAccounting-CombinedPowellMead.xlsx)** to your computer.
1. Move the Excel file to be a Google Sheet in a Google Drive folder associated with your Google Account.
1. Invite the other players to join the Google Sheet. Copy + share the URL to the Sheet. Or in the upper right of the Google Sheet, click the **Share** button. Add emails, and set permissions so players can access the Google Sheet.
1. In the Google Sheet, select the left-most worksheet *ReadMe-Directions*. Follow the further directions to start and complete the role play.
