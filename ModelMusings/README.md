## Overview														
**The purpose of the interactive models in this Github repository are to provoke thought and discussion** about renegotiations of operations for Lake Powell and Lake Mead. More specifically: how to convert a shrinking pie (lose-lose) water conflict -- our Colorado River basin becoming more arid -- into more positive processes for people and endangered fish? Links to existing Lake Powell and Lake Mead operations:

 * [2007 Interim Guidelines](https://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/programs/strategies/RecordofDecision.pdf).
 * [2019 Drought Contingency Plans](https://www.usbr.gov/dcp/finaldocs.html). **Both operations expire in 2026**.

**Interactive Model**: Participants synchronously connect to a cloud model for the Colorado River basin. Participants role play Upper Basin, Lower Basin, Mexico, and other parties. Participants make 
 year-to-year water conservation, consumption, purchase, and sale decisions for their party while they track other players' choices, account balances, reservoir storage, and impacts to Grand Canyon fish.

Each interactive model includes a name, key features, requirements and directions to use, files, and comparisons to current basin operations.

Presently there is one interactive model in the repository.

 * **To make interactive**: download the [Excel model file](https://github.com/dzeke/ColoradoRiverCoding/raw/main/ModelMusings/PilotFlexAccounting-CombinedPowellMead.xlsx) and move into a Google Sheet.

## Pilot flex accounting to encourage more water conservation in a combined Lake Powell-Lake Mead system

**Visuals of key benefits and features: [PilotFlexAccounting-KeyIdeas.pdf](https://github.com/dzeke/ColoradoRiverCoding/raw/main/ModelMusings/PilotFlexAccounting-KeyIdeas.pdf)**.

## Individual and Collective Benefits

1. Give each party more flexibility to make their individual water consumption, conservation, and reservoir storage decisions independent of other parties.
1. Parties manage all available water not just prior conserved water (Intentionally Created Surplus balances).
1. Adapt parties consumption and conservation decisions to basin inflows to give more flexibility to slow reservoir draw down ([Rosenberg, 2021a](https://github.com/dzeke/ColoradoRiverCoding/raw/main/BlogDrafts/2-AdaptLakeMeadReleasesToInflowsToGiveManagersMoreFlexibilityToSlowReservoirDrawDown.docx)).
1. Include more parties such as Colorado River Delta managers, First Nations, and managers for Grand Canyon ecosystems.
1. More flexibility to store water in Lake Powell and release cooler water that maintains the status quo for native, endangered fish of the Grand Canyon ([Wheeler et al, 2021, Sidebar 1, p. 47](https://qcnr.usu.edu/coloradoriver/files/WhitePaper6.pdf)) and delay triggering Endangered Species Act.
1. Carry over Lower Basin and Mexico conservation account balances into flex accounts.
1. Nudge "my basin", "my reservoir", and "my contingency plan" mentality towards "our" reservoirs.

**How the process works**

1. Stretch the Lee Ferry compact point into a region of combined management that starts with Lake Powell inflows and ends with Lake Mead releases (see [Slide #3](https://github.com/dzeke/ColoradoRiverCoding/raw/main/ModelMusings/PilotFlexAccounting-KeyIdeas.pdf))
1. Assign parties a flex account in the combined Lake Powell-Lake Mead system.
1. Assign existing reservoir storage to accounts.
1. Parties split each year's natural flow.
1. Each party's available water is their flex account balance, plus share of natural flow, minus share of reservoir evaporation, plus water purchases, minus sales (see [Slide #4](https://github.com/dzeke/ColoradoRiverCoding/raw/main/ModelMusings/PilotFlexAccounting-KeyIdeas.pdf))
1. Parties may buy or sell water from other parties. These are transactions among flex accounts in the combined system. Avoids wheeling.
1. Each party conserves or consumes within their available water independent of other parties.
1. Parties jointly decide how physically store water in Lake Powell and Lake Mead (e.g., consider fish and hydropower). Parties retain access to storage whether water is in Lake Powell or Lake Mead.

## Directions to Use
1. Download the file **[PilotFlexAccounting-CombinedPowellMead.xlsx](https://github.com/dzeke/ColoradoRiverCoding/raw/main/ModelMusings/PilotFlexAccounting-CombinedPowellMead.xlsx)** to your computer.
1. Move the Excel file to your Google Drive.
1. Invite the other players to join the Google Sheet. Copy + share the URL to the Sheet. Or in the upper right of the Google Sheet, click the **Share** button. Add emails, and set permissions so players can access the Google Sheet.
1. All participants open the **Master** worksheet.
1. Duplicate the **Master** worksheet to save a blank version for later use.
1. Follow directions in Column A.
1. Find linked help in Column N.
1. View the **Master-Plots** worksheet to compare entries to current operations (Law of River).

## Model Structure

This interactive model is a structured **spreadsheet** (Google Sheet). 
 * **Rows** represent the components of an interactive water budget for a combined Lake Powell-Lake Mead system.
 * **Colummns** represent years. 
 * **Interactive** means the players enter some components of the water budget year by year. Interactive components are individual and joint
 political/management decisions such as:
      * Water consumption and conservation.
	  * Water purchases or sales: volumes and payments. 
      * Add parties or stakeholders.
	  * Split existing reservoir storage among parties.
	  * Split future inflows among parties. 
	  * Raise or lower the level of the shared, reserve account.
      * Physically split combined storage between Lake Powell and Lake Mead. 	  
  
**Treatment of Uncertainties**:
 * Hydrologic: Players or a facilitator choose each year's basin natural flows.
 * Water demands: Players enter their water conservation and consumption choices year by year within their available water independent of other parties.
 
## Requirements to Use
1. A Google account. [Create a Google account](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?hl=en&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp)
1. Another participant (for synchronous, interactive modeling). A participant may role play one or more parties (e.g., Upper Basin and Mexico).
1. ~ 1 to 2 hours. Go slow. If you run out of time, schedule another session.

## Compare to Current Operations
The **Master**, **8.1-Trade**, and **MillenniumRecover** worksheets come with companion **-LawOfRiver** and **-Plots** worksheets. Select the **-Plots** worksheets to compare flex accounting entries to current operations (Law of the River). Use the **Master** worksheet to compare your entries to current operations.
