## Overview														
The purpose of this activity is to discuss more adaptive Colorado River operations than existing operations that equalize reservoirs and expire in 2026. To provoke discussion, download the **Excel Model File** (ColoradoRiverBasinAccounts.xlsx), move to Google Sheets, and invite participants. There are accounts for the Upper Basin, Lower Basin, Mexico, Colorado River Delta, First Nations, and a shared reserve. Over one or more years, participants consume, save, and trade water in the accounts, protect reservoirs, and sustain endangered, native fish of the Grand Canyon. Read on for directions to use.
## Rquirements
**Facilitator**: 1 person to setup in Google Sheets (see Setup below), invite participants, and organize play.											

**Number of People**: 2 or more (facilitator may also participate).

**Time**: 1 to 3 hours.

**Software**: Facilitator has a Google Account.

## Facilitation Directions

**Setup**

1. Download the file **ColoradoRiverBasinAccounts.xlsx** to your computer.

1. Move the Excel file to your Google Drive. Open as a Google Sheet.

1. Open the **Versions** Worksheet to see updates.

1. Duplicate the **Master** Worksheet to save a blank version for later use.

1. Invite 1 or more other people to join the Google Sheet.

   1. In the upper right of the Google Sheet, click the **Share** button.
   
   1. Add emails, and set permissions so players can access the Google Sheet. Or copy and share the sheet's URL.

**Use**

1. On the **Master** Worksheet, scroll down Column A. Participants enter values in rows with ðŸŸ¦ `Blue text`.

   1. For example, in Rows 4-10, particants select a **Account** and enter a **Strategy**. If fewer than 6 participants, participants select multiple parties.
   
   1. Enter the Lake Powell natural flow for Year 1 in ðŸŸ© `Cell C28`. Cells below will populate.
   
   1. Participants continue to enter values in Year 1 (Column C) down to Row 142 in row blocks with ðŸŸ¦ `Blue text`.
   
   1. Move to Year 2 (Column D). Enter Lake Powell natural flow in ðŸŸ© `Cell D28`.
   
1. Find linked help for each row in ðŸŸ¨ `Column N`.

1. View the **Master-Plots** worksheet to compare entries to current operations (Law of River).

1. **ReadMe-Directions** Worksheet also has these directions and describes all worksheets in the Workbook.
