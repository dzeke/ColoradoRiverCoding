# Colorado River Futures - Code Projects

Small and bigger coding efforts in support of work on the Colorado River. Some of the figures generated appear in papers on the Colorado River Futures project website (https://qcnr.usu.edu/coloradoriver/futures)

All coding efforts in R Studio.

Most of these efforts are beginning coding efforts and works in progress.

## Explanation of Contents

1. **BlogDrafts** - Preprints of blogs in the series "Encouraging more water conservation in the Colorado River Basin".
1. **CombinedPowellMead** - Plots of combined Lake Powell and Lake Mead storage over time.
1. **EvapCalcs** - Plots to show reservoir evaporation for Lakes Mead and Powell as a function of reservoir storage/level. This supports
an alternative management paradigm where reservoir evaporation is counted as part of lower basin users consumptive use.
1. **GrandCanyonInterveningFlow** - Plots of Grand Canyon intervening flow between Lake Powell and Lake Mead to help characterize inflows to Lake Mead.
1. **ICS** - Plots of intentionally created surplus (ICS) for Lake Mead account balances, puts and takes, limits, and comparison of ICS efforts to mandatory Drought Contigency Plan contributions.
1. **InterimShortageGuidelines** - plots of cutbacks in deliveries as a function of Lake Mead level. Both for the Interim Guidelines and newly released Drought Contingency Plan.
1. **LakePowellTemperatureScenarios** - Calcualtes the Lake Powell release temperatures for different lake levels. Assigns release temperatures to different fish scenarios.
1. **LowerBasinAgUses** - Plots of CRSS consumptive use input data for Lower Basin states.
1. **MeadPowellPlots** - visualization of the Lake Powell-Lake Mead Equalization rules. This is Powell annual release as a function of Powell storage and Mead storage. Also includes plots that show the reservoir zones.
1. **PilotFlexAccounting** - Pilot flex accounting to encourage more water conservation in a combined Lake Powell-Lake Mead system. Spreadsheet tool and directions for players to try out and give feedback on a Pilot flex accounting tool and role play.
1. **Powell10Year** - Plots showing Lake Powell 10-year releases in comparison to Colorado River Compact Article III(d) requirement
1. **Runge_MCDM_Analysis** - interactive parallel coordinate plot visualization of the 18 objectives use in the analysis by Runge et al of Glend Canyon Dam management alternatives. Runge, M. C., LaGory, K. E., Russell, K., Balsom, J. R., Butler, R. A., Coggins, J. L. G., Grantz, K. A., Hayse, J., Hlohowskyj, I., Korman, J., May, J. E., O'Rourke, D. J., Poch, L. A., Prairie, J. R., VanKuiken, J. C., Van Lonkhuyzen, R. A., Varyu, D. R., Verhaaren, B. T., Veselka, T. D., Williams, N. T., Wuthrich, K. K., Yackulic, C. B., Billerbeck, R. P., and Knowles, G. W. (2015). "Decision analysis to support development of the Glen Canyon Dam long-term experimental and management plan." 2015-5176, U.S. Geological Survey, Reston, VA. http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20155176.
1. **TimeToDeadPool** - a steady deterministic scenario analysis of the number of years to hit Lake Mead dead pool (or other target elevation) given a starting storage volume and steady reservoir inflow. Used to explore scenarios of inflow from 7 to 14 maf per year every year and identify potential effects of additional voluntary water conservation.

## Directions to Run

1. Download this repository to your local machine (towards top of webpage, click green **Code** button => **Download Zip**). Unzip contents.
1. Download and install R (https://cran.r-project.org/) and RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/).
1. Within the a downloaded subfolder, open the .Rproject file. R Studio will open.
1. Select the tab for the R Markdown file (.Rmd) and click **Knit**.
1. The code will generate a single PDF file of the same file name with all results.
1. If the subfolder does not have an .Rmd file, select the tab for the .R file in  R Studio. Select all the code (Ctrl-A), and run (Ctrl-enter or click the **Run** button on the tool bar below the file tabs). The results will generate in the console.

This repository is updated as new work is undertaken.
