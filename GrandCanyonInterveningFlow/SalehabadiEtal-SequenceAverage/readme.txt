Sequence-Average and Cumulative Flow Loss analyses performed by Salehabadi, Tarboton et al. (2020) to examine the severity of sustained droughts that have impact on storage and water supply in the Colorado River Basin.

In this resource, there are two scripts and one Excel file.

     •	"SeqAvePlot.R" : R code to generate Sequence-Average plots.
     •	"CumulativeFlowLoss.R" : R- code to generate Cumulative Flow Loss plots.
     •	"R_InputData.xlsx" : Input file for the scripts comprising two sheets as follows. 
                             1. “AnnualWYTotalNaturalFlow_LF2018” sheet, which contains the annual water year total natural flow at Lees Ferry from U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, (2020), https://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g4000/NaturalFlow/current.html. 
                             2. “TR_Meko_2017-SK” sheet, which contains annual tree ring reconstructed flow at Lees Ferry from the most skillful model of Meko et al., 2017.
